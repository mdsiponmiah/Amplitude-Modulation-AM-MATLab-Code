# Amplitude-Modulation-AM-MATLab-Code
Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in communication systems where the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier wave is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of a lower-frequency message (information) signal, while the carrierâ€™s frequency and phase remain constant.
